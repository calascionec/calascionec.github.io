Hi! My name is Chris and I am a student at Epicodus in Portland, OR.

I am originally from Mobile, Alabama, but I grew up in Charlotte, NC. I moved to Durham, NC for high school and then Chapel Hill, NC for college. After college, I decided to stay in Chapel Hill where I worked at a local restaurant as a floor manager and a bartender. While I enjoyed working in the service industry and gained many valuable skills, I decided that it just wasn't what I wanted to do anymore.

I've always been interested in computers and how they work. In high school, I took classes that focused on computer and network engineering. I built my own computers and volunteered at my school to help with computer upgrades and maintenance, but never learned how to program. About a year ago I decided to change that. I started with Learn Python the Hard Way and [CodeCademy] (http://www.codecademy.com). After about a month or so I was hooked and wanted to really focus on learning more. That's when I stumbled across coding bootcamps and decided to enroll at Epicodus.

In August, I started learning how to program full time at Epicodus. I am currently in the last two weeks of the program and will be starting an internship at [Plus QA] (http://www.plusqa.com) in November. At Epicodus, I've spent everyday building different web apps. For a more detailed explanation of my time at Epicodus check out [this blog post] ({{site.url}}/What-Ive-Been-Doing)!

Now I am beginning my search for my first job as a junior web developer. I'm excited to continue to learn new things and to grow as a developer.



Thanks for reading!
