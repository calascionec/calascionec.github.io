# Hello World!

This is my first post on my new site! I needed to make a portfolio site and decided that I should try out having a blog. I have been hearing about Jekyll for a little while now and decided to give it a shot. As far as the design of this website goes, I hope to keep it simple. With Jekyll I should be able to keep things simple while maintaining complete control over the look and feel of the site. I guess that will be all for this post for now...
