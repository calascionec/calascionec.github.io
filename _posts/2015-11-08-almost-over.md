Even though it feels like class just started, there is only one week left. I definitely learned a lot and got to meet some really cool people. For this last week, I'll be working on a group project to make a site with Drupal. While some other Epicodus students and I were at a meetup on Saturday we were introduced to someone that was founding a startup and needed a site made. The plan right now is to try and make a very barebones site with some core functionality and present it next week.  It's going to be a site that allows people to plan trips together and share the costs. I think this will be difficult but doable.

Another thing I have to start working on is my project for demo day. During the first week in December we are having a bunch of companies come in to take a look at projects that we have all been working on. The only problem is I have no idea what I am making yet!
