And this is my first post on my new site! I decided to go with [Jekyll] (https://jekyllrb.com/) to make my site. It was super easy to set up and is supported by GitHub so deployment was a breeze. To get started, I used the [Hyde Theme] (https://github.com/poole/hyde) by [Mark Otto] (http://markdotto.com/). I've been a fan of his blog and really prefer simple layouts. I plan to try making my own themes in the future!

Please feel free to take a look around, just remember that this is day one of me working on the site!
