title: Last Day
---

Somehow it has been three months and today is the last day of class. It's been a fun experience learning at Epicodus. I've met so many great people and feel that I've learned a lot. On Monday, I start an internship at [Plus QA] (http://www.plusqa.com), where I will be learning front-end QA. I'm looking forward to learning something new and working with a new group of people.

Now that class is over I'm going to have to spend more time looking around for junior development positions. While I am open to moving just about anywhere for a job, I do hope that I can make it back the Raleigh-Durham area. Portland has been great, but it isn't home.
