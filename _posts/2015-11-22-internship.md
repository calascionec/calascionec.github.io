Somehow class is already over and I finished my first week at my internship! Those three months of classes were a lot of fun and flew by. On Monday, I started my internship at Plus QA. Over the next few weeks, I will be learning about the process of front-end QA. On the first day, I was assigned to a team and started helping with the project they were working on. It was a website for a large car manufacturer and we were testing the websites layout, functionality, and responsiveness. Right away I was finding issues and logging them on their in-house bug tracking software. It was really interesting to test out the website on many different desktops, browsers, and mobile devices. Tomorrow I get to start my next week there and should be placed on a different team. I'll try and update again after the next week!
