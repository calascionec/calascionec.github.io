Tap That was my first group project at Epicodus. The idea was to make a site that allowed you to find what beers were on tap at local bars. Most bars these days do a good job of listing their draft beers online, but it is difficult to search for a specific beer and find where it is currently being poured. I spent my time helping to build that classes that we would need to retrieve and display our data. I also worked on the front-end design and layout of the site. We used PHP for our back-end, the PHP framework Silex for routes, MySQL for the database, Twig as our front-end template engine, jQuery for our search bar, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.  I worked on this project with a great group of people: Alexandra Brown, Phillip Shannon, Austin Blanchard, Deron Johnson.
