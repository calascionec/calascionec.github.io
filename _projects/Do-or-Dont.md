Do or Don't is a simple app that allows a user to ask a question when they need advice from others. It is an app made with AngularJS and Firebase. This is my first time using a NoSQL database. Currently I am working on making it look a lot better than it does now and cleaning up the code that allows it to use Firebase. Currently, everything is handled by controllers and the code that communicates with Firebase should be placed in a service.
